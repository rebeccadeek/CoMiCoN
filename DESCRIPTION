Description: CoMiCoN is an R package for fitting bivariate copula models with mixture margins to zero-inflated proportion data. The package implements two-stage estimation of the marginal and copula parameters, as well as a two-stage likelihood ratio test for the copula dependence parameter. The estimated dependence parameters can be used to build covariation networks.
